  The Strategy design pattern is <em>neat</em>. It decouples algorithm implementations
  (the how) from the objects that use them (the what). This separation means the cost
  of changing either the algorithm or the code that uses it is nice and low
  because we only need to change a small area of the code at a time.

<p>
  I, like most reasonable people, enjoy cake. Here I have a Cake class that's going to
  make me a cake. It even gives me the choice of baking it in a gas or electric oven.
  How cool is that?
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  class Cake

    def initialize(gas_oven: false)
      @gas_oven = gas_oven
    end

    def make
      puts "Mixing sugar and butter"
      puts "Beating the eggs"
      puts "Mixing sugar, butter, eggs, and flour"
      if @gas_oven
        bake_in_gas_oven
      else
        bake_in_electric_oven
      end
    end

    private

    def bake_in_gas_oven
      puts "Heating oven to gas mark 4"
      puts "Baking cake..."
      puts [true, false].sample ? "Oh dear! You burned the cake! ðŸ˜¬" : "Golden brown! Perfect!"
    end

    def bake_in_electric_oven
      puts "Heating oven to 180c"
      puts "Baking cake..."
      puts "Golden brown! Perfect!"
    end

  end

  Cake.new.make
  # => Mixing sugar and butter
  # => Beating the eggs
  # => Mixing sugar, butter, eggs, and flour
  # => Heating oven to 180c
  # => Baking cake...
  # => Golden brown! Perfect!

  Cake.new(gas_oven: true).make
  # => Mixing sugar and butter
  # => Beating the eggs
  # => Mixing sugar, butter, eggs, and flour
  # => Heating oven to gas mark 4
  # => Baking cake...
  # => Oh dear! You burned the cake! ðŸ˜¬

</pre>

<h2>Why is this code good?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As it stands, it's fairly simple and easy to understand. Someone coming into
    this code base could get up to speed in no time. (How understandable will this be when we
    have 10 different ovens though? The condition <span class="code">if @gas_oven ...</span>
     is going to get lengthy!)</li>
  <li>It (sometimes) makes me a delicious cake - it gets the job done, don't overlook this!</li>
  <li>The logic of how each oven bakes cakes is encapsulated in the <span class="code">bake_in_gas_oven</span>
and <span class="code">bake_in_electric_oven</span> methods. This means we can change how the
  ovens bake cakes without touching the <span class="code">make</span> method. If we
  don't touch something we're less likely to break it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is this code bad?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    It breaks the <strong>Single Responsibilty Principle</strong> (a class should
    have only one reason to change)
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Should the Cake class really know the details of gas and electric ovens? Probably not. If we
        were to decouple ovens from our Cake class we would be able to change the oven implementations
        without touching the Cake class.
      </li>
      <li>What happens when we want to add a new type of oven? My friend Harriet just persuaded me
        to buy a <em>totes amaze</em> AGA. Make the Cake class bake my cake in it, please. To do so
        you would need to go into the Cake class and add a new <span class="code">bake_in_aga</span>
        method and update the condition in the <span class="code">make</span> method.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Those <span class="code">bake_in_gas_oven</span> and <span class="code">bake_in_electric_oven</span>
    methods share the <span class="code">bake</span> prefix. This is usually an indicator that they
    belong in a separate class.
  </li>
  <li>The tests for the Cake class will need to cover the logic for ovens. I'd say that it
    shouldn't really be the responsibility of the Cake tests to check that a gas oven
    bakes cakes correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can't change the baking algorithm dynamically at run-time (we're limited to gas and
    electric ovens). This might not be a problem, but it would be nice if the Cake class
    didn't give two hoots about what kind of oven we used to bake the cake or how that oven
    decided to go about it, just that it <em>could</em> bake a cake.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How can we make it better?</h2>

<p>
  The main problem here is that there's too much going on inside the Cake class. We need to move
the oven logic outta there.
</p>

<h3>A first pass - Inheritance</h3>
<p>
  An attractive solution at first might be to introduce some inheritance. This
would mean having a Cake base class and several subclasses that encapsulated the baking
logic. They could be called something like <span class="code">GasOvenCake</span> and
<span class="code">ElectricOvenCake</span>. It reads a bit weird though and that's because it <em>is</em> a bit weird.
</p>
<img src="/images/strategy-design-pattern/cake-inheritance-5fc6621d.svg" alt="Cake inheritance class diagram" class="blog-post-image" />
<p>We've shoved the <em>IS-A</em> relationship where it doesn't really belong. Still, we're heading
in the right direction, we've extracted out the oven implementations into separate classes. To add a new
oven all we need to do is subclass Cake. This is nice because we don't need to touch any of
the other oven implementations.</p>
<p>A draw back here though is that each oven's baking algorithm is still tightly coupled to the Cake class.
  We have a concrete Cake class knowing the details of the oven its going to get baked in.</p>
<p>Also, what happens when we introduce a new type of cake? Say we want to make a fruit cake, this
would subclass the Cake class (it <em>is-a</em> cake), but it should also be possible to bake it in
any type of oven. Things get tricky at this point. What would the class diagram look like?</p>
<img src="/images/strategy-design-pattern/fruit-cake-inheritance-5edf4fb7.svg" alt="Fruit cake inheritance class diagram" class="blog-post-image" />
<p>It doesn't look like inheritance is the right thing to do here. Let's take a look
  at another approach.</p>

<h3>A second pass - Strategy Design Pattern</h3>
<p>Let's try and tackle the coupling between the oven and the cake. There's an OOP principle that
  states <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">favour composition over inheritance</a></em> - I think it would apply nicely here.
</p>
<p>Instead of having the cake subclasses implement the oven logic, let's extract it into its own class and use composition to store an Oven reference inside Cake. Here we have a Cake context class, and several
  strategies that the context can use to get the job done:</p>
  <img src="/images/strategy-design-pattern/fruit-cake-composition-16e16a25.svg" class="blog-post-image" alt="Cake composition class diagram" />
<p>At this point our oven and cake have a much looser coupling. We're free to add new cakes
  without touching any oven code, and we're free to add new ovens without touching cake code.
  The cost of change in our codebase has just had a massive reduction. We can be fairly confident that if we break a cake we aren't breaking an oven while we're on. From a psychological point of view this
  is fantastic- team members are going to be much more likely to fix bugs and add new functionality
  if they know exactly what areas of the code they will be touching.</p>
<p>By using composition we've also gained the advantage of being able to switch out the oven
  implementation during run-time:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
  cake = Cake.new(oven: GasOven.new)
  cake.make
  # => Mixing sugar and butter
  # => Beating the eggs
  # => Mixing sugar, butter, eggs, and flour
  # => Heating oven to gas mark 4
  # => Baking cake...
  # => Oh dear! You burned the cake! ðŸ˜¬
  cake.oven = ElectricOven.new
  cake.make
  # => Mixing sugar and butter
  # => Beating the eggs
  # => Mixing sugar, butter, eggs, and flour
  # => Heating oven to 180c
  # => Baking cake...
  # => Golden brown! Perfect!
</code></pre>
<p>If we need to, we can also pass the context into the strategies. This would be useful if
  the bake method in the Oven classes required some information about what it was cooking- the size
  of the cake could, for example, affect the temperature and time needed in the oven. However, it's
  worth pointing out that by doing this we could be introducing a dependency that
  didn't exist before. Keep an eye on the coupling to make sure that cakes and ovens
  don't get muddled together again.</p>
