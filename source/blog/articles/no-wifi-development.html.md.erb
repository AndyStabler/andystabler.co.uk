title: No-Wi-Fi Development

I was recently on a long haul flight from Manchester to San Francisco with _no Wi-Fi_. As you can imagine,
between regular snacks and naps, it was quite the struggle. A few hours into the flight, I decided to pop
out my laptop anyway to do some development– what happened next was both disturbing and magical.

Without the helping hand of The Google or colleages to pester with my questions I had to (wait for it) think for
myself. *****This might seem a bit ridiculous (and honestly, maybe it is), but as an internet dwelling millenial it's
something I haven't done in probably over a decade. It took about 2 minutes for me to discover just how little I
actually knew. I panicked and my imposter syndrome grew three sizes that day, but once I'd calmed down a bit
(enter cup of tea), I began working with what little I do keep in my head. The result was fascinating.

Here's what I was working on.

I've recently been doing some API work and wanted to see how much of the OAuth2 protocol I could remember. I wanted
to make a simple Ruby program where I had models for an authorisation server and a resource server. I could then
make a call to get an authorisation grant, swap it for a token, and then use that token to access a resource.

The first thing I wanted to do was have my tests run frequently. Usually I'd use Guard for this (Guard runs the
tests whenever a file is modified), but the thing is Guard is usually set up on projects I work on, and if it's
not I'd Just Google It™. So what do? I wrote the following down on some paper:

> Things I don't know
> 1. Guard

I then had to figure out a way to get the tests to run 


discovered just how little I know. With
no where to run, I had to find ways to achieve 

Here's what I was up to.
